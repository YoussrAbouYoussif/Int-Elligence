How Dynamic Form works

A Model called FormTypes will have the constraints of forms of the same formType , also it will have the constraints of the object contained in an array attribute in the form
A dynamic form will have a formType where it must have the constraints of its formType, the Dynamic Form model although is empty 
which means the Dynamic Form Collection has different types of forms 

The code also handles dependencies between attributes but to some extent explained further 
Any other dependencies or constraints should be revised by the lawyer when the investor submits the form 

FormTypes Syntax

attribute:type,required,min,max,unique,Frontend

where type is one of (string,number,date,array,object,objectId)
      required states it is required or not (required=>to be required,anything else=>not required)
      minimum value for number and minimum length for strings (doesn't work with objects,arrays,objectIds,dates)
      max same as min
      unique states it is unique or not (unique=>to be unique,anything else=>not unique)
      Frontend states the type of component needed for frontend

Dependencies Syntax

First dependencies is how are attributes dependant on each others , for example in SSC forms is the nationality is not egyptian the equity captial is more than 100000

syntax 

attribute:dependantAtt,is,min,max,valid/equal,length

where dependantAtt is the attribute that the meant attribute is depending on
      is => the value where the the dependantAtt affects attribute
      min => min value , if not specified it is ignored
      max => max value , if not specified it is ignored
      valid/equal => exact value , valid for strings,equals for numbers, overrides the previous constraints
      length => exact length of input , overrides all the previous constraints

NOTE: every att can have one depending attribute, the depending attribute is preferred to be mentioned before the attribute in formTypes
NOTE 2: dependencies works only with strings and integers , but dependending attributes can be anything 


FormTypes,DynamicForms,Dependencies all of them must hape an attribute called formType in them , it is the brain of how the algorithm works
